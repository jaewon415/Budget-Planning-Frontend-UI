There are five main pages in the budget planning UI:
-	**Home Page**: Budget planners typically don’t stick with just one budget because there are too many uncertainties about the future. The whole point of a budget is to set expectations over a certain period of time and measure performance against the actual. This page will allow a planner to compare actual against budget to measure year-to-date performance and make strategic decisions accordingly.

-	**Create Page**: Making a budget plan is the first step toward the budget process. The planner can think of this process as designing a template for the budget plan – the planning period may be in months, quarters, or even years. The planner should complete the form on the create page with the right information. The required entries are the name of the budget plan, the planning duration, the base planning period, and the plan description (constraints, access control, and roll-up if applicable)

-	**Plan Page**: The plan page reduces the time to create and delete a budget plan while adding more reliability to the budget data. The planner can merge, clone, and edit plans in the plan graph database and speed up the budgeting process. That said, one can only process one budget at a time – the planner cannot clone multiple budget plans in one click.

-	**Table Page**: This page is not on the navigation bar on the left, but one can navigate to the table page by creating a budget plan from the create page or clicking the edit plan button on the plan page. The budget spreadsheet on this page can take numeric values and text formulas like that of excel. 

-	**History Page**: The history page gives the planner access to old copies of the budget plans and shows the number of each version as well as who created each version and when. The planner can restore the old budget plan from this page.
